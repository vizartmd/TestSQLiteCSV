Application for parsing CSV file, writting good-data in SQLite database, bad-data in CSV file and statistics in Log file

First of all I tryed to parse CSV file and see the information from file in console.
I observed that not all tge rows is completed
I was filtered and separated complete rows (successful) from incomplet rows (unsuccessful) and grouping they in
two LinkedLists.
I deleted first row from successful List because it contains the title of column, which also corresponded to the filtering conditions
but it did not have to be entered into the database.
Precisely for this reason I created a LinkedList in which the removal of the first element is more efficient than in the ArrayList
