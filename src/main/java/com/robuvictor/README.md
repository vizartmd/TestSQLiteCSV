Java application for reading, filtering data from CSV file and writing data to SQLite database and CSV file.
                                                 
Stages of application development:
(The approach I took to solve the challenge)

1) Separation of complete fields from incomplete ones and grouping them in "bad-data" and "good-data".
2) Write "good-data" in a table to be created in SQLite.
3) Write "bad-data" in bad-data- <timestamp> .csv file
4)
5)
6)


end) Write statistics about all records (received, successful and failed) in log files
